* Introduction

The Personal Working Environment (PWE) is a most excellent implement devised for the purposes of both development and the dignified management of one’s affairs, wrought upon the noble foundation of LISP. The PWE moulds itself unto the needs of its master, affording ample opportunities for the utmost personalisation and flexibility in one’s labours.

* Principles and Functions

** Flexible and Dynamic Arrangement of the Working Environment

   - A prodigious capacity for the instantaneous arrangement of the interface and faculties according to one’s immediate undertakings, by virtue of the boundless flexibility inherent to LISP.
   - Literary programming and a code, which in itself bears the virtue of self-documentation.
   - Modularity, bestowing ease of adding new faculties and implements.
   - Profound capabilities for the customisation of the interface and implements, the creation of one’s own commands and mechanical incantations (macros).
   - The automation of daily toils, expediting the execution of one's tasks.

** A Universal Platform for Development
   - Support for various tongues of programming and frameworks through modules and extensions.
   - Harmonious integration with the most principal implements of development: systems of version control, repositories of data, instruments of testing, containerisation, and the rhythms of Continuous Integration and Delivery.
   - Implements in-built for the analysis of code, its elegant refactoring and the noble pursuit of debugging, all in compatibility with LSP and DAP.

** Effective Command of Tasks and Projects
   - Enhanced possibilities for the planning and proper organisation of affairs and projects.
   - Implements for the keeping of accounts with respect to time spent, the maintenance of notes, and the drafting of schedules.

** Deep Connexion with the Operating System and Internet-Services
   - The governance of the file system and resources of the operating system directly from the PWE, ensuring thus a singularity of interface.
   - In-built clients for the transmission of mail, for the browsing of the world-wide web, for the reading of public broadsheets (RSS), and for those messengers through which communication is centralised and rendered more convenient.
   - The support of REST and GraphQL, that one may work with web-based protocols and integrate with the diverse pantheon of external services.

** Automation and Scripting
   - The composition and execution of scripts in the noble tongue of LISP, for the automation of mundane tasks and for the handling of data.
   - Integration with implements external, such that the orchestration of working processes is both possible and dignified.
   - Patterns and templates for the generation of both code and documentation, rendering the commencement of new projects an easier burden to bear.

** Artificial Intelligence and the Study of Mechanical Learning
   - The integration of implements devoted to the study of artificial intelligence, for the analysis of data and for the generation of code.
   - The prudent use of previously-trained models, bestowing abilities of pattern recognition and the high art of language processing, all within the tranquil boundaries of the working environment.
   - In-built faculties for the creation and the trial of one’s own models of machine learning.

** Collaborative Labour and the Celestial Spheres of the Cloud
   - Implements for the conduct of business with cloud repositories, to ensure both access and the exchange of documents.
   - Remote access to services and infrastructure, furnished via the commendable arts of SSH and VPN.

** Containers and Virtualisation
   - Implements for the masterful management of Docker and Kubernetes containers, that the deployment and the watching over of applications may proceed apace.
   - Support for the labour with virtual machines, to enable the testing of applications in solitude and isolation.
   - The automation of the governance of virtual abodes, with scenarios scripted for such purposes.

** Minimalism and the Pursuit of Ergonomics
   - An interface conceived upon the noble precepts of minimalism, to augment both productivity and the gentleman’s comfort.
   - Flexible arrangement of the working space, according to one’s personal inclination.
   - Efficient means of managing resources, that stable operation might grace even those machines of humble endowment.

** Security and Reliability
   - Implements for the safeguarding of code and data, including the encrypting thereof, and the careful keeping of credentials.
   - Regular renewal and update, that one may remain ever protected from the invisible menace of threats and vulnerabilities.

** The Community, Support, and the Glorious Ecosystem of Extensions
   - An open ecosystem and a most active community, proffering a multitude of extensions for affairs of sundry types.
   - The integration of analytical instruments and the governance of versions within the working environment itself.
   - A lively society of developers and users, ever fountaining knowledge and mutual support.
   - Extensive documentation and abundant instructive materials, that the inquirer may always find answer to his or her learned questions.
